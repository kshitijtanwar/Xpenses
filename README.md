# Expense Tracker React Project

Welcome to my Expense Tracker React project! This is a simple practice project that allows users to input their expenses and displays them in a well-organized manner. Additionally, it provides the functionality to filter the expenses based on the year of spending.

## Features

- **Expense Input:** Users can input their expenses, including the description, amount, and date of spending.

- **Expense List:** The project neatly displays the entered expenses, showing details such as the description, amount, and date.

- **Expense Filtering:** Users can filter the displayed expenses by selecting a specific year. The project then presents only the expenses incurred during that year.
